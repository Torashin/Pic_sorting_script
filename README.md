# Pic Sorting Script

Currently broken - should be fixed soon!

## Overview 
This project started as a personal endeavor to organize my photo and home video libraries. Over time, it grew to become
a fairly capable tool for sorting and managing media files. Recognizing its potential usefulness to others, I've
decided to make it freely available.

The Pic Sorting Script is designed to analyze the metadata, creation dates, and modified dates of media files, along
with any dates found in the parent folder, to determine the most likely correct date that a photo or video was taken.
It offers options to copy or move the files to a structured YYYY-MM folder format and can optionally rename the copied
or moved files based on the chosen date.

Additionally, the script includes functionality to recognize duplicate files. When duplicate files are detected, the
script moves or copies them into a separate folder while maintaining the original folder hierarchy.

## Disclaimer 
While I've put considerable effort into ensuring the reliability and functionality of this tool, it's important to note
that it originated as a personal project. As such, there may be bugs or unforeseen issues. Users are encouraged to
exercise caution and make backups of their files before using this tool. Additionally, users without coding experience
should proceed with caution and may find it challenging to use the script effectively.
